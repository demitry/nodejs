Hello from NodeJs

Using the Attached Source Code
Throughout this course, we'll write a lot of code.

To give you the possibility of comparing your code to mine (to find + fix potential errors in your code), you'll find multiple code snapshots per module attached to different lectures in this course.

The last lecture of each module always contains all snapshots for the module, ordered chronologically.

You can view the code and compare it to yours or replace (parts of) your code with it temporarily (to narrow down the issue).

How do you use the attached code?

BEFORE we started using npm, you simply run the main .js file via node - just as we do it in the videos. Or you simply look into the code files to view + compare the code.

AFTER we started using npm, you need to run npm install inside of the extracted code attachment before you can run npm start to run the server.
