//One other feature, we'll use from time to time are template literals: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals
//It's a different way of writing strings.
//Instead of using double or single quotation marks:
// 'A String'
// or
// "Another string"
// you can use backticks (`)
// `Another way of writing strings`
// Now why would we use that way of creating strings?
// With that syntax, you can dynamically add data into a string like this:

const myName = "Max";
const myAge = 29;
console.log(`My name is ${myName} and I am ${myAge} years old.`);
// This is of course shorter and easier to read than the "old" way of concatenating strings:

// const name = "Max";
// const age = 29;
// console.log("My name is " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old.");
